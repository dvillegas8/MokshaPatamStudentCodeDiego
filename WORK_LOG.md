| September 2   | 12:30 - 1:00  |                                                      Thinking about how to approach this problem, looking through the problems to see how many rolls I need for each one, I came up with an idea to see which ladder gives us the most movement to reach the end faster, wrote a function to find the ladder above |
| September 2   |  1:00 - 1:30  |                                     Stuck on what to do next, got an idea about creating a function that calculates how many rolls you need to get to the destination, confused on how to implement snakes into my function, finished the amount of rolls you need. However, I still need to test if my code works |
| September 2   |  6:00 - 6:30  | Working on main function and decided to use a while loop for this problem set, confused on what to do next, thinking about changing the get first ladder function into a function that finds the next ladder if there is any available, worked on the main function, still confused on how to implement the snakes |
| September 3-4 | 11:50P- 12:20 |                                                                                                                                                                  Creating variables like queues and arrays, looking through the lecture notes and writing down pseudocode, turned some of the pseudocode into code |
